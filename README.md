# üá≤üá¶ Zelij Quiz

Zelij Quiz is an interactive self-assessment quiz designed to help users compare their perception of Morocco's national performance with the facts established by globally recognized composite indices (HDI, Corruption Perception Index, Global Competitiveness Report, etc.).

The core goal is simple: to foster factual awareness by challenging personal estimates (often biased by patriotic overestimation) against objective, sourced, and up-to-date international data.

## üöÄ Key Features

- 100% Client-Side & No-Data Policy: The entire quiz is implemented using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No data is collected, stored, or transmitted to any server. Your anonymity is fully guaranteed.

- Immediate Confrontation: The source of the correct factual answer is revealed after every question to ensure instant, factual learning and combat misinformation.

- Open Source & Auditable: The code is completely transparent, allowing anyone to audit the sources and data used in the test.

## ‚ú® Nice-to-Have

- [ ] More Questions: Expanding the question bank to cover more domains and indices.

- [ ] Question Randomization & Limitation: Implementing logic to randomly select a subset of questions (e.g., 7 out of 20 total) for each test session.

## üõ† Project Structure

The application consists of a single HTML file and its embedded assets (CSS and JS). Hard-coded question data are in Yaml format (`src/i18n.yaml`)
